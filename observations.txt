WEB-APP:

	16/02/2022
	"react-scripts": "4.0.3"
	react-scripts 4.0.3 is required because react-scripts 5.0.0 upgrated the webpack 5
	webpack 5 removed node polyfills (which are needed to run blockchain/crypto related libs)

	17/02/2022
	"react-error-overlay": "6.0.9"
	this package is required since this (earlier) version allows for use of the process variable
	this is needed in order to use enviromental variables (.env file)
	not sure why this is necessary as of yet
